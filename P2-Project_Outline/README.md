### Overview
Household Manager

Our household manager application will allow for the creation of a household account and individual user profile. Each user profile will be linked to the household account. 
Each user profile will have the opportunity to create chores and select the frequency for how often they would like the chore to show up on their to-do list. There is also potential
for the lead household account to set permissions for other users access to the different features of the app. 

A nice feature of this app, for both the app in itself and for the sake of learning, is that the core features within the database of searching, updating, reading, and deleting the database
can be easily applied to other additional fields such as pantry items and budget.


### Features
Shared login: 
	Users will be able to create a shared account and log in to the application. A shared password will be used for those in the same household.
Individual Profile: 
	Each user within a shared household will have an individual profile within the shared household.
Chore database: 
	An organized and structured database containing all possible chore categories, options, and the users' selection options. Users will be able to create which chores they want on their list, and how frequently they would like each chore to show up on that list.
	They might also get the option to select which individual profile is responsible for the maintenence/completion of each chore.
Authentication:
	Users will only be able to access the household account and/or individual profiles with the correct login information
Access (There's a different word for it, but I can't remember)
	The household manager/owner/account holder will have control at which features the different profiles will have access to change or choose
Set Frequency of Chore:
	Users will be able to set how frequently they want to do and be reminded to do certain chores
Fun and Unique Namespace
	The names for commonly used words in the app such as list and chores have fun names to create joy and increase useage in opt-in for youth. Potential to be toggle-able.
